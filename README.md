# CognoRise Infotech - Data Science Internship Projects 🚀

Welcome to the CognoRise Infotech Data Science Internship repository! 👋 This repository contains the projects I am working on as part of my internship from October 10, 2024 to November 10, 2024.

## About the Internship 🌟

During this internship, I aim to sharpen my data science skills by completing various hands-on projects. Each project in this repository focuses on different aspects of machine learning, data preprocessing, and predictive modelling, helping me gain insights and experience in real-world data analysis.

## Projects 📊

Here is the list of tasks I will be working on during my internship:

1. Iris Flower Classification 🌸
   - A machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into species based on sepal and petal measurements.
   - Dataset: [Iris Flower Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)

2. Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳
   - A model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using classification algorithms and data preprocessing techniques.
